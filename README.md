# Ecommerce-Sales-Analysis

This project analyzed web traffic, sales data, order detail, customer records and product list from an online fashion store. It mainly answered 4 questions:
1. Does the website traffic have significant influence on the orders?
2. Is there any significant correlation between different products?
3. Does the promotion (discount) used in the data promote sales?
4. Suggestion for the growth of sales.

Seven suggestions were extracted through the analysis:
1.	Improve website design & visitor experience to increase web traffic. The focus needs to be placed on the good months: March, August, November, Late May, and Early June. Those periods are the times when people buy much more than usual.
2.	Increase exposures of the ‘top products in unit sales’ to customers. Look at products with top failure rate and figure out whether the order failed because of the products themselves and why. Could analyze customer reviews and conduct customer surveys to solve the issue.
3.	Building recommendations & product bundles based on product correlations & results of Market Basket Analysis. Need to avoid product pairs with negative relationships.
4.	Decrease the amounts of overall discounts, since customers are not encouraged by promotion. Could conduct further experiment to figure out whether discounts have different effects on different customer groups or time periods.
5.	Focus the marketing budgets on valuable customers. Encourage them to buy more frequently, offer better shipping options to reduce the shipping rate. 
6.	Send reminders and conduct surveys for common (or low-value) customers, especially those with only one order, find out why they are unsatisfied with the store.
7.	Build predictive models to detect potential valuable customers out of new registered users or guests, using their behavior data & demographic information. Encourage the potential valuable customers to make their first order soon after registration.
